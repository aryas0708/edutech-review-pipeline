The course took 1 year to complete and you may wonder how. The promised time of completion of course was 7 months. The classes are only 1 hour 30 minutes in which 20 minutes will go for taking attendance online and offline making it only around 1 hour daily. Imagine 1 hour spent daily for an entire one year.. Now coming to the syllabus... They will teach only the introduction and rest of them we have to study by our own which i did. But things become worse when the course was about to end. No placements for students.They promised placement support but they doesn't keep their word. Overall i got 2 interviews from them in which one is unpaid and other is unpaid for 3 months and 10k per month. Most of the companies they give us for attending interviews are startups and majority won't give us salary. Now you will see some negative reviews and many positive reviews also. But i must say the positive ones are forced by the management and you may not get placement if you post negatively. That's why even i am posting this review in a fake account. The owners are greedy and they don't provide placement support for the students. 75% of placements you see them posting on social media are not done by them rather by the students itself. Better ask students (atleast 5) on LinkedIn about this fraud institute and then take a decision.,1,Negative,-0.9009,Negative,267,1466,0.044079685746352404,0.5038159371492704,Positive

152,RedTeam Hacker Academy,2024-11-30,Aravind  ss,cybersecurity,"**Please do not fall For Placement Traps !!! **So, from my experience.I completed Cpt v3 from Redteam Trivandrum, I was going to take CICSA but they recommended CPT v3. From my experience, their CPT v3 is a wider course to be completed within 3 months. After Completing the Course they will conduct 2 interviews ( within the branch) only after passing the first 2 interviews you will be connected with a company for a real Interview. Our Guide was Abhishek Sir, He is a great tutor he helped us a lot. Please join Abhishek sir's class if you are planning to join.After Attending interview (1) from the branch they selected us and added us to a group of 50+ students. From there I attended (2) but didn't get selected. I studied CPT and the opening position was for soc so they said to learn soc too.The CPT course cost 25k but this certificate is not internationally valid. I just applied to some companies that are asking 3+ years experience to get into Fresher penetration tester pos or VAPT. And 0-2 years exp will be selected (but If you have done self-projects, bug bounty, internships,udemy course, Hall of Fame is fine)

1. If you want a certificate please take an internationally valid certificate (like certficates issued by the EC council etc... eventought *an EC council certificate is not even enough to get jobs)

2. If you want a job then please don't join Red Team without thinking or doing some research, like what part of cyber security job you want like red/blue teaming? , is this course relevant now? Etc.

3. Please ensure that the course syllabus you are joining is up to date, also just enquire how many are getting placed after completing the course ( If you can find the placed or previous students online like from LinkedIn communicate with them directly ). Also, ask how many are placed from the branch you are joining. From Trivandrum, only a few are being placed. So make sure and ask them before joining. ( It's your right and responsibility to enquire and it's your money paying for a course ).

RedTeam Academy is a great choice for those who want to ""LEARN"" cybersecurity ( If you are new to cybersecurity ). It a great to get the knowledge they have some talented and experienced trainers also they give ideas and pathways on how to learn something. The all staff are well amazing and good behavior.But to get a job, Please DO some deep research . It may not be completely their fault too, because without research you will join some courses and get bored and will not get a job, also do some projects apart from their class learn tools and read the latest news and techniques. RedTeam is not only enough to get jobs also self-learning is important after completing their course. I have just talked with many students, like CPT+CEH, and ADCD. They also completed these courses but didn't land job until now. Only 3 chances for the final interview.

Please Do some research before joining, I'm not blaming anyone or anything. However, being jobless even after completing courses is hard to take.

Do Research. Self Learn. Do Projects. Bug bounty. Take an Internationally valid certificate. Check syllabus. Take Internships. Ask for help on LinkedIn. Build network. Keep Learning Keep Updating.

All the best. üôÇüëç",3,Neutral,0.9987,Positive,566,3244,0.2586950330371383,0.5834425077846132,Positive

One of the worst placement services you could ever imagine. They will tell you that you will be placed with at least 5 LPA if you complete and follow all the things the mentor has given you (like projects, mock interview) ,They will do nothing about you placement for your placement for the time being they will add you in a WhatsApp placement group and tell you your resume has been forwarded to this companies and most of this companies are in North

2) Learning journey
Nothing special and very poor sessions took nearly 3 Months to complete html and css itself, initially they said it is 7 months course and within 4 months they will complete front end and you will be getting interviews for frontend but they took 8 months to cover front end itself and not cover all the topic which was mentioned in the brochure and after that also they didn't arrange any interview, when I asked someone in the placement group he said they scammed him and wasted a complete year. A very poor way of conveying details about the subject needed to learn a lot ourselves didn't get much support from the mentors total exhaust.

3 Fee structure
Paid a total of 47k (single payment )- wasted
If you are taking it in EMI it is 57k
Once after the fee paid you are done the coordinator (mine is shanmitha ) won't respond to you, you will have to call them multiple times to reach them

4) how I got my job
After applying to a lot of jobs in LinkedIn , Nakuri, indeed I didn't get any calls, With a help a friend I joined a company. This institute didn't have a single credit in this
I quit my job and started studying - but they didn't care about anything

Conclusion:-
Please don't enroll here and waste your money
Of course they are gonna reply to me that I am not a part of the program (if they do iam going to leave another review with the certificate provided by them with email )
They just removed all the members from the group today, I am attaching this for your reference",1,Negative,-0.9642,Negative,393,2098,-0.08093253968253968,0.3934722222222222,Negative

The classes lack organization and structure, leaving students feeling frustrated. The office environment is toxic, with employees more interested in gossiping than in improving their skills.

The leadership team, including individuals like Naveen, Manoj, Ram, and Shanmitha, display unprofessional behavior, especially towards female colleagues, gossiping about them, creating a negative atmosphere. Their lack of leadership and ethical standards damages the company's reputation and potential for growth.

Many of us, myself included, struggle to find placements despite investing time and money into Skill Safari. It's disappointing to see them profit while failing to deliver on their promises.
